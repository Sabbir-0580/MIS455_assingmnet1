                Robotics combines engineering and computer science to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These machines range from industrial robots in manufacturing, enhancing precision and efficiency, to service robots in healthcare, assisting with surgeries and patient care. Robotics also plays a crucial role in exploration, with robots conducting missions in hazardous environments like deep-sea or space exploration. The impact of robotics extends to everyday life, with innovations in home automation and personal assistance. By augmenting human capabilities, robotics is transforming industries, improving productivity, and opening new frontiers in research and development.

                Computer vision, a field of artificial intelligence, enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. Using techniques like image processing, pattern recognition, and deep learning, it powers applications such as facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. In retail, computer vision enhances inventory management and customer analytics. In agriculture, it aids in crop monitoring and disease detection. Its impact is significant in improving security through surveillance systems and in advancing augmented reality technologies. By enabling machines to "see" and analyze visual data, computer vision transforms various industries, driving efficiency and innovation.
